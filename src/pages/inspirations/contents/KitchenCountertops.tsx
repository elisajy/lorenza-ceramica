            <p>In this age of quarantine and social distancing, your kitchen has probably seen more traffic than ever.&nbsp; No more daily <em>Indomee goreng</em> and <em>teh tarik</em> at the <em>mamak</em> (for now). Instead, you can enjoy healthy food at home, with your homegrown herbs and vegetables too!</p>
            <p>If you have been thinking of renovating your kitchen for a while, this new normal is another reason to do so.</p>
            <p>One area that you need to pay a lot of attention to is your kitchen countertop. This is where you are going to prepare your food, spill the ketchup, and splash the cooking oil. This is your battle station. As such, you need to pick the right material!</p>
            <p>In this article, we will go over three types of high-quality kitchen countertop for Malaysian homes, starting with…</p>
            <h2><span className="has-text-color">1. Marble kitchen countertop</span></h2>
            <p>Nothing makes you feel like you’re checking in a 5-star hotel like a marble surface. Of course, this classy look comes with a price, literally and figuratively.</p>
            <img style={{ maxWidth: "400px" }} src="https://lorenzaceramica.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bean-counter-9CSDYMH-1-1024x682.jpg" alt="post-banner"></img>
            <p>Pros:</p>
            <ul style={{ paddingLeft: "2rem" }}><li>Marble countertops can increase the resale value of the property</li><li>With a lot of care, marble countertops can last for a long time</li><li>Since it is made from natural stone, the appearance is unique and versatile. Marble also comes in different hues, although black and white are the most common</li><li>It can withstand high temperature, making it a good option for baking. However, common advice will still ask you to place your hot cast iron pan on a piece of clothing to protect the surface.</li><li>Marble is made from natural stones, thus making it environmentally sustainable.</li></ul>
            <p>Cons:</p>
            <ul style={{ paddingLeft: "2rem" }}><li>Not cheap. Although you might be able to get back your investment upon resale, it’s good to keep the initial cost in mind.</li><li>Marble is heavy, whether it comes in a slab or as tiles. It’s best to hire a professional to install it safely, and to make sure your kitchen cabinet sturdy enough to support the weight.</li><li>Requires a lot of care. Due to its porous characteristic, spills can seep into the surface and become stains.</li><li>Not ideal for heavy use. Marble is one of the softer stones, so it is still susceptible to scratches and cracks. So, if you’re cooking a small <em>kenduri</em> regularly, you might want to consider sturdier materials.</li></ul>
            <h2><span className="has-text-color">2. Granite kitchen countertop</span></h2>
            <img style={{ maxWidth: "400px" }} src="https://lorenzaceramica.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-2021-03-16-at-3.08.42-PM.png" alt="post-banner"></img>
            <p>When it comes to cooking, we Malaysians are not known for our delicateness. Vegetables need to be chopped, plates need to be stacked and dragged, utensils need to be accidentally dropped.</p>
            <p>If durability is your priority, you will do well with a granite countertop.</p>
            <p>Pros:</p>
            <ul style={{ paddingLeft: "2rem" }}><li>The surface is highly durable. Granite ranks high on <a href="https://marble.com/articles/granite-hardness"><span style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}><span style={{ color: "#0071a1" }} className="has-inline-color">Mohs scale of hardness</span></span></a>, meaning that the material is resistant to scratching or abrasion.</li><li>It can withstand high temperature. Again, it’s still best to use a trivet or potholder to protect the countertop.</li><li>Easy to maintain. Granite is resistant to stains or chemicals. It’s high durability also means that granite is resistant to cracks or chipping.</li><li>Just like marble, granite is made from natural stones, thus making it environmentally sustainable.</li></ul>
            <p>Cons:</p>
            <ul style={{ paddingLeft: "2rem" }}><li>Granite can be slightly expensive, although still not as expensive as marble</li><li>Due to its porous characteristic, spills can seep into the surface and become stains. However, this is easily avoidable with a proper sealant.</li></ul>
            <h2><span className="has-text-color">3. Ceramic kitchen countertop</span></h2>
            <p>Lastly, here’s the most commonly found kitchen countertop in Malaysia, ceramic tiles!</p>
            <img style={{ maxWidth: "400px" }} src="https://lorenzaceramica.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blue-and-White-Tile-Kitchen-Countertops-1-1024x695.jpg" alt="post-banner"></img>
            <p></p>
            <p>Pros:</p>
            <ul style={{ paddingLeft: "2rem" }}><li>Its price is cheap and affordable, as compared to marble or granite.</li><li>Ceramic tiles come in a wide variety of colours, patterns, and sizes. You’ll surely have a lot of fun in choosing and planning your kitchen renovation. You can also match your countertop design with your backsplash.</li><li>Easy to clean. Just make sure you wipe it regularly with soap, water, and non-acidic cleaners.</li><li>By replacing traditional grout with epoxy grout, the grout lines become water and stain resistant, making them easier to clean. &nbsp;</li></ul>
            <p>Cons:</p>
            <ul style={{ paddingLeft: "2rem" }}><li>Prone to cracking. It doesn’t happen as often, but your ceramic tiles can crack or chip if you place your premium iron skillet a little bit too hard on the surface. When there’s a damage, you also need to make sure you replace the broken tiles with ones of the same size and design.</li></ul>
