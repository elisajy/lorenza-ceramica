            <p>Whether it’s the morning toilet session while scrolling through Facebook (we know you do), or the long shower after a long sweaty day in this humid Malaysian weather, our bathroom breaks are the most relaxing parts of the day.</p>
            <p>Which is why, when it comes to interior design, you should not neglect the bathroom and toilet!</p>
            <p>In this article, we will share some creative and imaginative ideas for your next bathroom renovation. Some are large scale renovations, while some others only require a few pieces of small furniture!</p>
            <h2 className="has-text-color">1. It’s worth to spend more on your bathroom tiles</h2>
            <p><a href="https://lorenzaceramica.com/products/room/bathroom"><span style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}><span style={{ color: "#005399" }} className="has-inline-color">Bathroom tiles</span></span></a> price might be higher than that of other areas in the house since they have to withstand the heaviest usage. Think of the large amount of water being splashed every day, not to mention the cleaning chemicals and the intense scrubbing.</p>
            <p>Thankfully, bathrooms don’t occupy too much space, so it’s easier for you to plan your budget.</p>
            <p>Vinyl tiles are the most common due to their low cost, while still being durable and easy to install.</p>
            <p>Ceramic and porcelain are costlier, at the same time are more versatile in terms of design. And for a small space, the overall cost won’t make too much dent in your budget. These tiles also typically require more skill to install, so make sure you consult your professionals to make sure they cut and fitted appropriately.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h2 className="has-text-color">2. Pick bathroom walls that match your flooring</h2>
            <p>Your selection in bathroom flooring naturally leads to your selection in bathroom walls as well. The usage is the same, since water splashes and heat go bounce everywhere inside the area.</p>
            <p>For bathroom walls tiling, the common selections are ceramic or glass tile. Pay attention to the size of the tiles as well, as tiles that are too small might make a bathroom look really crowded.</p>
            <h2 className="has-text-color">3. You can get creative in storing items</h2>
            <img style={{ maxWidth: "400px" }} src="https://lorenzaceramica.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lorenza_bathroom_2.png" alt="post-banner"></img>

            <p>If you’re racking your brain trying to compromise form over function, choose both!</p>
            <p>To make the most out of your limited space, make sure you look for storage units that can double up as décor. Get some baskets to store your toiletries, while a ladder shelf does wonders to hang your towels.</p>
            <h2 className="has-text-color">4. Add some life into your bathroom with houseplants</h2>
            <img style={{ maxWidth: "400px" }} src="https://lorenzaceramica.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lorenza_bathroom_4.png" alt="post-banner"></img>
            <p>Image: <a href="https://pxhere.com/en/photo/1245581"><span style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}><span style={{ color: "#005399" }} className="has-inline-color">Pxhere</span></span></a></p>
            <p>Just because you’re living in a concrete jungle such as KUALA LUMPUR or Kota Damansara, that doesn’t mean you need to deprive yourself of real greens!</p>
            <p>Visit your neighborhood nursery to get advice on the right plants for your bathroom. They will tell you how much sunlight the plants require, what is the suitable humidity and temperature levels, and how often should you water them. You’ll be a plant parent in no time!</p>
            <p>Take note that selecting the right plants will improve the air quality in your bathroom.</p>
            <h2 className="has-text-color">5. Use floating shelves to store more item</h2>
            <p>Don’t let all that vertical space go to waste!</p>
            <p>There are plenty of cheap options for bathroom shelves, such as this <span style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}><span style={{ color: "#005399" }} className="has-inline-color"><a href="https://www.ikea.com/my/en/p/kalkgrund-glass-shelf-20292903/">glass shelf</a> </span></span>for RM59, or this <a href="https://www.ikea.com/my/en/p/brogrund-wall-shelf-with-towel-rail-stainless-steel-30333984/"><span style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}><span style={{ color: "#005399" }} className="has-inline-color">towel rail</span></span></a> for RM69. Even the smallest ones can make a big difference to your bathroom as you will be able to free up space your sink countertop.</p>
            <p>Just make sure you get written permission from your landlord first, if you’re installing them in a rented unit.</p>
            <h2 className="has-text-color">6. Install a vanity cabinet</h2>
            <img style={{ maxWidth: "400px" }} src="https://lorenzaceramica.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lorenza_bathroom_5.png" alt="post-banner"></img>
            <p>Image: <a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/bathroom-vanity-toilet-counter-1078917/"><span style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}><span style={{ color: "#005399" }} className="has-inline-color">Pixabay</span></span></a></p>
            <p>A vanity cabinet might not be a common fixture in Malaysian homes, especially if you are renting. Yet it is really useful to be made as a main storage or the bathroom. This way, you can keep your sink countertop neat and clean, and you don’t have to go back and forth just to refill your toilet rolls.</p>
            <p>If you’re looking to start, you can get a basic set such as <a href="https://www.ikea.com/my/en/p/godmorgon-braviken-bathroom-furniture-set-of-4-white-stained-oak-effect-brogrund-tap-s19332453/"><span style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}><span style={{ color: "#005399" }} className="has-inline-color">this one from IKEA</span></span></a> at under RM1.5K. Pro tip: It can be uninstalled and you can take it when you’re moving to your own place.</p>
            <h2 className="has-text-color">7. Replace shower curtains with glass panels</h2>
            <p>Shower curtains have received a bad rep since the invention of horror movies. So, to make sure you can weed out potential Norman Bates’, replace them with glass panels. This will make the bathroom feel more spacious and allow natural light to bounce through the room.</p>
            <h2 className="has-text-color">8. Install a large mirror</h2>
            <img style={{ maxWidth: "400px" }} src="https://lorenzaceramica.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lorenza_bathroom_6.png" alt="post-banner"></img>
            <p>Image: <a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/bath-mirror-real-estate-2660937/"><span style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}><span style={{ color: "#005399" }} className="has-inline-color">Pixabay</span></span></a></p>
            <p>A sizeable mirror offers a lot more benefits than you can imagine, including:</p>
            <ul><li>Adding an illusion of space to make the room appear larger</li><li>Brightening the room by reflecting light</li><li>With good lighting, mirrors provide ample space for you to groom yourself. A good mirror can really affect how you start your day!</li></ul>
            <p>Thankfully when it comes to mirrors, they are not limited to the size of your bathroom. You can still install a frameless mirror from the sink countertop all the way to the ceiling. No one’s that tall, but the room will surely look more prestigious and feel more spacious.</p>
